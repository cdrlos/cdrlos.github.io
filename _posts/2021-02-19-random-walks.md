### Introduction

The random walk is perhaps everyone's first introduction to the theory of
stochastic processes. You many not even know what a stochastic process but if
you've taken probability you've surely heard of the random walk. With my
previous post on Brownian motion I mentioned that Brownian motion is the
continuous analogue of the symmetric random walk. In this post I aim to
formalize that and remind you of what exactly we mean by random walk--in case
you need a refresher.

### Simple Random Walk on $$\mathbf{Z}^2$$
We will start with the case of $$\mathbf{Z}^2$$ as it is the first non-trivial
example of a simple random walk. $$\mathbf{Z}^2$$ is of course the integer
lattice in $$\mathbf{R}^2$$ and has the prototypical basis $$\{(1,0),(0,1)\}$$.
