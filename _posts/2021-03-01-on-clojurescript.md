title: On ClojureScript
---

Two weeks ago I was contacted by a recruiter looking for a developer with
Clojure experience. It's always been a dream of mine to make a living out of
Lisp jumped at the opportunity. Now, I'm not quite a software developer just yet
and solving several dozen problems on [4Clojure](https://www.4clojure.com) many
years ago does not amount to very much experience in the language although I
would say my understanding of Scheme and it's core principles, naming
conventions, homoiconicity, adherence to functional programming, etc. are all
very valuable skills for this. Nevertheless, Clojure isn't just Scheme on the
JVM, it diverges from it quite significantly at it's core, and as I brush up for
what is sure to be an interview nightmare I am reminded that
[ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) is a thing.

I've recently been looking into web-dev as a potential career path for myself
seeing as I've failed to secure a data science/data analysis job which my
background in mathematics is extremely well suited for---but not my lack of
experience, and experience is the game changer isn't it. Web-dev seems like a
lot of fun, it's relatively easy to get into, it looks much more competitive but
a lot less formal and corporate than data science, and there are a ton of cool
people working in the field.

### Introduction to ClojureScript
In this post I thought I'd introduce you to ClojureScript, or more specifically Clojure and build a small app with it. 

### Our First Web App
This is my first web app using ClojureScript as well so enjoy!
