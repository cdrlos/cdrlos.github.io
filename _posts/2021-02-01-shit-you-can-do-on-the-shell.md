title: Shit you can do on the shell
---

I recently applied for a programming slave job with [Smoothstack](https://wwww.smoothstack.com) (a _better_ [Revature](https://revature.com)?) and they had me take an assessment for their Java software engineering track. For some reason they consider Bash scripting to be important component of their admissions so I thought I'd write a post about it.

You could always just read the docs but there's way too much information---information you don't need. So today I thought I'd write a post featuring some of the functionality I personally care about when writing bash scripts.

## Getting started
So you're writing your very first Bash script, at the top of your document you want ot have `#!/bin/bash`
