## Introduction
This post is a precursor to an upcoming post on the [Black--Scholes
equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_equation) (and
introduction to financial mathematics in general) and follows my previous post
on random walks. Unfortunately for us, a thorough understanding of stochastic
calculus is necessary to fully understand the equation. But before we can even
start talking about stochastic calculus we need to review Brownian motion. Now
this post is not meant to be a comprehensive bottom-up guide on the subject for
that you can go read Durrett's [Probability: Theory and
Examples](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Cambridge-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521765390)
or Klebaner's [Introduction to Stochastic Calculus with
Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Stochastic-Calculus-Applications-2Nd/dp/186094566X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=klebaner&qid=1612983088&s=books&sr=1-2)
which is the book which introduced me to this subject.

### Brownian motion in a nutshell
Brownian motion is named after the Scottish botanist [Robert
Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist,_born_1773)) who is
widely credited with being the first to observe and describe the motion. The
story goes that Brown, attentively observing grains of pollen suspended in water
[^1], observed the jittery motion of tiny particles expelled by the pollen
grains. In his words

This is what he probably saw. 

Now getting back to the nitty-gritty of the task at hand. 

## Defining a Brownian motion
A Brownian motion requires 

[^1]: But why would he be looking at pollen suspended in water? As I recently found out, a lot of Brown's work was devoted to showing that pollen characteristics can be used to aid in the classification of plants into genera.
