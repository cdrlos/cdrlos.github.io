I recently applied for an apprenticeship with
[Smoothstack](https://wwww.smoothstack.com) (a _better_
[Revature](https://revature.com)?) and they had me take an assessment for their
Java software engineering track. For some reason they consider familiarity with
Bash scripting to be an important component of their admissions.

## Getting started

So you're writing your very first Bash script, at the top of your document you
want ot have `#!/bin/bash`
