### What is speculation?
Speculation is popularly regarded as unethical behavior. The thought goes that speculation is in large part responsible for the rise and fall in prices of certain commodities and therefore detrimental to the layman, and that it is tantamount to gambling, i.e., that it serves no purpose other than personal gain. Now, there are plenty of articles and blog posts out there defending this behavior as not only ethical (?), but beneficial and necessary for the proper pricing of markets and assets. What I will do today is make a case against speculation; hold the popular view and formalize their reasoning.

### Why it is bad

### Counterfeiting stock
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all the participants: the short hedge funds, the prime brokers, and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp (DTCC) make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.

Why is this important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement, or pension plans that hold stock it touches the majority of Americans.

The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to 'market forces' when they are often market manipulations.

The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start-up capital. Small businesses brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.

It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed --- the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off-shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.

### A glossary of illogical terms
The securities industry has its own jargon, laws, and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to.

1. **Broker dealer** or **prime broker**---The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house---also known as a broker's broker.
2. **Hedge funds**---Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be marker makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
3. **Short seller**---An individual, hedge fund, broker, or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as 'the shorts.'
4. **The Securities and Exchange Commission**---The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top-level management is a five-person board of governors who are presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2006 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
