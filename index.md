Welcome to my blog. This website here will showcase some of my current projects as well as offer me a platform to make blog posts. I briefly considred making blog posts on Medium, but I opted for GitHub since I belive this will give me the most flexibility. Enjoy!

Here is some Javascript for you:

~~~ javascript
const result = pipeline(100, [adder(1), adder(2)])
console.log(`adding 1 and 2 to 100 -> ${result}`)
~~~

And some math brought to you by [KaTeX](https://katex.org), it's blazing fast.

$$ X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n e^{-i2\pi kn/N}, \qquad k=0,\dotsc, N-1.$$

This is cool.
