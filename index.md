Welcome to my blog. This website here will showcase some of my current projects as well as offer me a platform to make blog posts. I briefly considred making blog posts on Medium to get myself hired, but I opted for GitHub since I belive this will give me the most flexibility at the expense of some overhead. Enjoy!

Here is some Javascript for you:

~~~ javascript
const result = pipeline(100, [adder(1), adder(2)])
console.log(`adding 1 and 2 to 100 -> ${result}`)
~~~
