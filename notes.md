I'm working through John Lees' book [Job Interviews: Top Answers to Tough Questions](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Interviews-answers-tough-questions/dp/0077119096) wherein he suggests that I keep a sheet of company facts and facts about myself and what I hae to offer.

## Personal worksheet
I'll start by listing what I have to offer to an employer. Since I did not succeed in graduating with my PhD, I have a big gaping hole in my resume which will be difficult to cover up, however I think this can be overcome if I can persuade my employer that I have the capability to add immediate value to their company.

Here's what I have to offer as an employee.

* What am I like
: diligent
: lax
: level-headed
: methodical
: patient
: perfectionist
: resourceful

* What I can do
  * Skills I use around **people**
: pay attention
: anticipate wants
: notice preferences
  * Skills I use with **technical problems**
  * Skills I use requiring **imagination & creativity**
  * Skills I use requiring **analysis & organization**
  : write things down in $$\LaTeX$$ or Markdown
  * Skills I use to solve **practical problems**
  * Skills I regularly use **outside work**

* What I know

* Activities that give me a *buzz*: List 10 activities you would like to do in a new job.

## Organization fact sheets
There's too many of these so I'll have to place them on their own page.
