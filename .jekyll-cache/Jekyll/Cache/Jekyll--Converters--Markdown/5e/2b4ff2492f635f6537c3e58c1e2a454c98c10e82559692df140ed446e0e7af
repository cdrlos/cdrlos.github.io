<p>This post is a precursor to an upcoming post on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_equation">Black–Scholes
equation</a> (and
introduction to financial mathematics in general) and follows my previous post
on random walks. Unfortunately for us, a thorough understanding of stochastic
calculus is necessary to fully understand the equation. But before we can even
start talking about stochastic calculus we need to review Brownian motion. Now
this post is not meant to be a comprehensive bottom-up guide on the subject for
that you can go read Durrett’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Cambridge-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521765390">Probability: Theory and
Examples</a>
or Klebaner’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Stochastic-Calculus-Applications-2Nd/dp/186094566X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=klebaner&amp;qid=1612983088&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">Introduction to Stochastic Calculus with
Applications</a>
which is the book which introduced me to this subject.</p>
