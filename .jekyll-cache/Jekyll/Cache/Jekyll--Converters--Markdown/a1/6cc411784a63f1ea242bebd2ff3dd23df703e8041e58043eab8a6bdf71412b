I"—<p>Two weeks ago I was contacted by a recruiter looking for a developer with Clojure experience. Itâ€™s always been a dream of mine to make a living out of Lisp jumped at the opportunity. Now, Iâ€™m not quite a software developer just yet and solving several dozen problems on <a href="https://www.4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> many years ago does not amount to very much experience in the language although I would say my understanding of Scheme and itâ€™s core principles, naming conventions, homoiconicity, adherence to functional programming, etc. are all very valuable skills for this. Nevertheless, Clojure isnâ€™t just Scheme on the JVM, it diverges from it quite significantly at itâ€™s core, and as I brush up for what is sure to be an interview nightmare I am reminded that <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a> is a thing.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve recently been looking into web-dev as a potential career path for myself seeing as Iâ€™ve failed to secure a data science/data analysis job which my background in mathematics is extremely well suited forâ€”but not my lack of experience, and experience is the game changer isnâ€™t it. Web-dev seems like a lot of fun, itâ€™s relatively easy to get into, it looks much more competitive but a lot less formal and corporate than data science, and there are a ton of cool people working in the field.</p>

<p>In this post I thought Iâ€™d introduce you to ClojureScript, or more specifically Clojure and build a small app with it.</p>

<h3 id="our-first-web-app">Our First Web App</h3>
<p>This is my first web app using ClojureScript as well so enjoy!</p>
