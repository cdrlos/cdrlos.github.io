I"ž<p>I recently applied for an apprenticeship with
<a href="https://wwww.smoothstack.com">Smoothstack</a> (a <em>better</em>
<a href="https://revature.com">Revature</a>?) and they had me take an assessment for their
Java software engineering track. For some reason they consider familiarity with
shell scripting to be an important component of their admissions, so I thought
Iâ€™d write a post to jog my memory.</p>
