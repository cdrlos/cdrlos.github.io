I"T<p>Two weeks ago I was contacted by a recruiter looking for a developer with Clojure experience. It’s always been a dream of mine to make a living out of Lisp jumped at the opportunity. Now, I’m not quite a software developer just yet and solving several dozen problems on <a href="https://www.4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> many years ago does not amount to very much experience in the language although I would say my understanding of Scheme and it’s core principles, naming conventions, homoiconicity, adherence to functional programming, etc. are all very valuable skills for this. Nevertheless, Clojure isn’t just Scheme on the JVM, it diverges from it quite significantly at it’s core, and as I brush up for what is sure to be an interview nightmare I am reminded that <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a> is a thing.</p>
