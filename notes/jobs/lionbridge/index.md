title: Online Map Analyst Assessment

  ## This should be easy
  'Should.'

I applied for a contract job through [Lionbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionbridge)---a somewhat reputable company that specializes in localization and software testing. The position is called _online map analyst_ and I will be tasked with "determining the relevance and accuracy of [map-related] information by performing online research." I take this to mean I will be improving some company's [web map services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) by by verifying the veracity of its search results.

Why am I needed for this task? You'd think some smart guy would have figured out a way to extract this information using an ML approach---parsing loads of information from the web. Either the data is too crude for an ML approach or it's computationally expensive (and the best solution is to hire a bunch of lackeys).

I have no insight as to the why this position exists. At any rate, I'll have to take an assessment before I get an offer. The assessment must be completed before the 22nd when offers go out. I'll read through the study guide they provided, take some of their practice assessments and see where it goes. This job could buy me some time to prepare for a proper software engineering job, which I am still struggling to find.

### Introduction

So what exactly does an online map analyst do? Reading through the first chapter of the notes, here's the gist of it:

- I am presented with the result of map search queries.
- I must assess the accuracy of the result.
- I will be using a so-called a **Rating Tool** for this.
- I will scan the web to correct or enrich (?) the content of the result.

So where are these queries coming from exactly? Maybe poorly rated Google Maps/Apple Maps results? I don't know, and when I find out I won't be allowed to say seeing as I must sign a non-disclosure agreement.

They have a rating work-flow diagrammed out for me. It goes like this

- Understand user intent.
- Establish relevance.
- Check data accuracy: name accuracy, address accuracy, pin accuracy.
