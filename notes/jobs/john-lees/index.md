title: John Lees' Organization Sheets

I started reading John Lees' book [Job Interviews: Top Answers to Tough Questions](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Interviews-answers-tough-questions/dp/0077119096). In the second chapter *Planning to succeed* he makes a very important suggestion:

>Use [an] organizational fact sheet to collect facts about the business ...[n]ext, use every job-related document you can, ... to fil in the job fact sheet.

I was already doing something akin to this, but it was not methodical plus it unorganized and as such treated like the rest of my notes, with slight disdain. I'm going to start taking this more seriously by writing the fact sheet down in Markdown and exposinig it to the internet. It goes without saying that I will not be doing this for every job I apply to, only the mid-to-high profile ones.
