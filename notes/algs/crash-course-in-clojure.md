I freaking love Lisp. If you're like me and your first exposure to computer

an [s-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression). What's the deal
with all the parentheses? Why can't I infix my addition operator? Where's the
main method? It's so ugly isn't it? And slowly but surely you begin to see the

cannot dream of doing in other languages or shy away because you find the syntax
too cumbersome. 

It's no secret that being a Lisp programmers dooms you to obscurity as most
developers deem the language too academic and old for modern software
development. Lisp does itself no favors when it encourages its users to develop
their own applications as opposed to relying and contributing to well
established libraries. That is primarily why Lisp has failed as a software
development language. But Lisp had a lot of good ideas and
