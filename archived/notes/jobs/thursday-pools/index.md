I got contacted by a recruiter---Ed Sherman---about a position at Thursday
Pools. According to Ed Thursday Pools is a fiberglass pool manufacturer based in
Indiana that is currently looking for a consultant to create a dynamic model
to help optimize revenue, profit, and customer satisfaction. So they need
someone who can calculate demand, logistics, inventory control etc.

OK, Ed doesn't want me. The job is unrealistic for me in all honesty. Ed is
looking for someone with 5+ years of experience in industry for his client, not
a fresh graduate. I wish he had been upfront about it. The company does not seem
to have a ready-made infrastructure for the sort of work they're looking for.
This means that they will be looking to hire people in the near future. Or not.
Maybe they'll be more realistic with their work and hone in on what it is they
are looking for and I suspect they're looking for someone to primarily do
logistics work and manage their database which right now appears to just be a
number of XLS spread sheets..?
