Hey!! You found the page. Here's a very unflattering picture of me.

What the hell is going on up there? 

I know it's a petty, but I've been concerned about the quality of my hair since
my mid 20s when I noticed one day that my hair had become a lot thinner than it
used to be---I started to see more of my scalp where before there was thick dark
hair. That's the other thing! My hair has gotten a lot thinner. Five years ago I
obsessed over the issue, but now I've come to accept it. But every now and then
when I see myself in the mirror I lament my aging hair. People will
subconsciously judge you on little things such as your appearance and while I
expect people to not be so judgmental, I know that I share in the burden of
making myself more presentable to them so that I am not unfairly treated. I
think the best thing to do is keep my hair short for now.
